## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned
Semantic HTML Structure

I learned how to properly use semantic tags like <main>, <footer>, <ul>, and <h1> to make my HTML more meaningful and accessible.
This improves SEO and ensures that screen readers can interpret my content correctly.

CSS Variables and Design System

I learned how to use :root to store CSS custom properties (variables) for colors, font sizes, and weights.
This makes the design consistent and easy to maintain.

:root {
  --clr-primary-Green: hsl(75, 94%, 57%);
  --clr-neutral-Off-Black: hsl(0, 0%, 8%);
  --ff: 'Inter', sans-serif;
  --fw-700: 700;
}

CSS Reset and Base Styling

I practiced resetting default browser styles using the universal selector * and improved typography and spacing consistency.

*,
*::before,
*::after {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

Responsive and Centered Layout

I used CSS Grid and the place-items: center; property to center my profile card both vertically and horizontally on the screen.

.wrapper {
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
  min-height: 100dvh;
}

Hover States and Smooth Transitions

I learned how to style link hover states and use transitions to make interactions feel smoother.

.list-item:hover {
  background: var(--clr-primary-Green);
  color: var(--clr-neutral-Off-Black);
  transition: background .3s ease, color .3s ease;
}


### Continued development

Responsive Design

I want to become more confident in creating layouts that adapt perfectly to different screen sizes.
I plan to practice more with media queries, Flexbox, and Grid combinations, as well as explore responsive units like em, rem, and clamp().

Accessibility and SEO Best Practices

Iâ€™ve learned the importance of writing semantic HTML, but I want to go deeper into accessibility features such as aria-labels, better heading hierarchy, and meaningful alt descriptions to make my pages more inclusive and SEO-friendly.

Scalable CSS and Code Organization

I want to improve how I organize my CSS by learning BEM naming conventions, using SASS/SCSS, and understanding better project architecture so my styles remain clean and easy to maintain as projects grow.
